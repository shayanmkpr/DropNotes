## Drop Down Notes Menue

This is just a to-do list like drop down menu that will be added to the menu bar on your mac (linux version will absolutely be made).

The idea here is to have a to-do list that is with you everywhere whenever you wanted to remind yourself what was it that you were doing while not taking so much of your screen real state.

## To do (Ironically)
- [ ] Change the logo in the menu bar.
- [ ] fix the "Quit" problem.
- [ ] fix the UI. Add notes should be in the drop down menu.
- [ ] Save the notes somewhere.
- [ ] Add git like capabilities.
- [ ] Add "workspaces" so people can have work and personal.
- [ ] Add remote fetching. Could use a git repo for it. two branches. one work, the other personal.
