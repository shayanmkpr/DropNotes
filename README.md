## Drop Down Notes Menue

This is just a to-do list like drop down menu that will be added to the menu bar on your mac (linux version will absolutely be made).

The idea here is to have a to-do list that is with you everywhere whenever you wanted to remind yourself what was it that you were doing while not taking so much of your screen real state.
